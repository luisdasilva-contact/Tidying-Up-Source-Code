Simple and straightforward - the source code for [Tidying Up](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/881447) (minus the API keys, of course!).

Well, maybe not _completely_ straightforward... I make this code open for use, but with a disclaimer: working on this game was a massive learning experience. I'm proud of the game our team was able to make, but under the hood, there's a fair bit I'd have done differently if I was starting it now. Large swathes of this could be made more efficient with significant overhauls, and there are plenty of spots where new features were effectively bolted on, rather than integrated. 

Why upload at all, then? One is the simple fact that I'd promised the team and players that I would, and I wanted to follow through. But another is that as messy as some sections are, there are others that are perfectly reusable; the Newgrounds API sections in particularly, especially the level sharing API, which has little in the way of documentation. There are a handful of other sections as well, such as the dialogue or hint systems. 

If you use any of these components or want to learn more, please feel free to reach out!
